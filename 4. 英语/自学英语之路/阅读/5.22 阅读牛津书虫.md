After the coffee and sandwiches, Inspector Walsh called Roger Clarkson to the office. Roger came in and sat down. The Inspector began at once.
'Now, Mr Clarkson. Why was your mother angry with you last night?'
'This house is very big,' Roger said. 'It was a lot of work for Mother. I wanted her to move. But no, she loved this house and garden. She didn't want to move.'
'Tell me about your job, Mr Clarkson. Your mother is dead and now you're rich. Do you need money?'
Roger's face was suddenly afraid. 'What are you saying? I didn't kill my mother. I need money, that's true. A friend and I want to build ten houses here, in this garden. We can get a lot of money for them. So. I wanted Mother to sell this house. It's true. But Mr Briggs wanted half the garden, too, you know, for his farm.'
Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table. 'Tell me, what happened upstairs? You went to your mother's room?'
'Yes, I did. I wanted to say good night to my mother.'
'Did you talk about the house again?'
'Yes, I did. Again, she said no. She loved the house and didn't want to sell it.'
Inspector Walsh watched Roger for a minute. 'I see. We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets, Mr Clarkson, in Diane's room.'
Roger's face did not change. 'Oh? Someone put them there. Diane did not kill my mother, I know that. She found the body.'
'Very well. I would like to see Diane next.'
Roger got up and left the room.
Inspector Walsh stood up and put his hands in his pockets. He went to the window and looked out at the trees. Why was Roger Clarkson afraid? 





was it important? He looked at Sergeant Foster.
'Tomorrow morning, go to Mr Clarkson's officeâ€”you have the name,' he said. 'Ask some questions about him, about his job, friends, money.'
Sergeant Foster wrote it down. 'Yes, Inspector.'
'A good day for tennis, Sergeant?'
Sergeant Foster laughed. 'Don't say that. It's not easy, you know. I don't like sitting here looking at the sun.'
Diane came into the room and sat down. She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled. 'I saw you at the Tennis Club last month, I think. You play very well.'
Sergeant Foster's face went red. Inspector Walsh looked at him, 'Oh yes. A fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster.' Diane smiled again at Sergeant Foster and his face went red der.
'Well, Miss Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh said, 'I want you to talk about last night.'
Diane stopped smiling. 'Oh, I can talk about last night. I can't stop talking about it. We were all angry. Mother went to bed early and I made hot milk for her. We were all in the kitchen, and Peter Hobbs came in. He nearly broke the back door down.' Diane stopped.
'Yes?'
'He was very angry about a letter. He wanted to kill Mother. Are you going to talk to him?'
'We're going to talk to everyone.'
'Good. Tom Briggs came into the kitchen, too. Are you going to talk to him?'
'I'm asking the questions, Miss Clarkson. When did you take the milk upstairs?'
'I went up after Roger.' She stopped for a minute. Then she began again. 'I didn't like my mother, Inspector. She killed my father, you know. Last winter, after Christmas, she drove the car into a tree and killed my father.'
