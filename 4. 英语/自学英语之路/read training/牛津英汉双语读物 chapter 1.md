Jackie went back into the kitchen and began to make some sandwiches. Just then the back door opened, and her mother came in.
'It's very hot!' Molly said. She took off her hat and put it down on the table. She was a tall, dark(成熟) woman with beautiful eyes.
Two big, black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her. She sat down and put her hands on their heads.
Jackie put the sandwiches on the table. 'Mother,' she said. 'Diane phoned. She wants money for her train ticket.'
Molly closed her eyes for a minute. Then she stood up. 'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend,' she said, 'Oh, and please go to the village later and get my tablets.'
'Yes, Mother,' Jackie said.
Molly went to the door.
