### **Restrictions will set you free.**

 /rɪˈstrɪkʃn/







By Derek Sivers



Someone says, "Write me a piece of music. Anything. No restrictions. Go!"

```
有人说，"给我写一首曲子。什么都可以。没有限制。去吧！"
```



You're stumped. It's the blank page syndrome.

 /stʌmp/

 /ˈsɪndrəʊm/

````
你被难住了。这就是空白页综合症
````



Instead(上扬), someone says, "Write me a piece of music  // using only a flute, ukulele, and this toy piano. You can only // use the notes D, E, and B. It has to start quiet, get louder, then end quietly. Go!"

 /ɪnˈsted/

/ˌju:kəˈleɪli/

```
```



Aha! Now that's an inspiring challenge!

 /ɪnˈspaɪərɪŋ/

```
现在这是一个令人激励的挑战
```



You can use this approach for business, too. **If you're feeling stuck with marketing, give yourself restrictions.**

 marketing    /ˈmɑ:kɪtɪŋ/

```
你也可以将这种方法用于商业。如果你觉得在营销方面被卡住了，给自己限制一下
```





* Contact fifty fans using only personal emails — no mass-mailing.
* Make a music video using only stock footage.
* Give promotion a time-limit of just 15 minutes per day.
* Spend a week only contacting people you've never contacted before.


Whenever you're feeling uninspired or unmotivated, use creative restrictions to set you free
