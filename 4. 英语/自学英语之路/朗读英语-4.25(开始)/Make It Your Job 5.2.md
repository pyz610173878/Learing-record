**Make It Your Job**



By Leo Babauta



When you’re feeling resentful or angry about something, it’s worth stopping to consider why.

This morning, I woke up to a dirty kitchen, and as I do most mornings, I started cleaning it up. Washing dishes, wiping counters, putting dishes away, and so on. I do this a lot.



And I found myself feeling resentful. Why didn’t other people clean this up? Why am I the one who has to clean it up all the time?



And I watched my resentment.



And I saw at its root a feeling of entitlement, that everyone should do things the way I want them to do it. A feeling of wanting to control others. A feeling that others should be what I want them to be. I’m at the center of the universe, and everyone else is a supporting character in my story.

/səˈpɔ:tɪŋ

kærəktə(r)

Of course, that’s not true. They are their own people, and don’t want to be controlled, and want to live how they want to live. I’m only a supporting character in their lives.



So I could have tried to force them to act my way. Better: I could teach them to clean up after themselves, to pitch in and be good members of our family.



But what I did instead this morning is assumed that I am a servant, and that it is my job to clean the kitchen. It’s my job to serve my family.

/əˈsju:m



The effect is that I released the idea that they should serve me, that they should do things my way. And instead I did the work without complaint, lovingly/ in the service of my loved ones.

/rɪˈli:s/

/kəmˈpleɪnt

I’ll still teach them, because that’s my job too, to serve them by showing them the best ways to live life. But I won’t do it with the resentment, only with the love.
