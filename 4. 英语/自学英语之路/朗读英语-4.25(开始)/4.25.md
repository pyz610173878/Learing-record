In my 15 years running two companies and two bands, I’ve employed about 100 people.



So from an employer’s point of view, here’s my best advice on how to get hired:



**Focus on one company**



Do some soul-searching to decide what you really want to do.

```
soul-searching ： 反思，自我剖析
做自我反思，然后决定自己真正想要什么
```



Then find the company in your area that you feel is doing it the best. The company needs to be near you already. If you don’t live near them, move there first, or choose a closer company. Do not do this remotely.



**It doesn’t matter if they’re not hiring.**

```
如果他们不找人，这不重要。
```



**Learn all about them.** Read every page of their website. Become a customer. Read every article about them. Study and memorize this info.



This only takes a few hours, and is a much better use of your time than blasting resumes.



If you don’t really want to work for this company, pick a different company and do this section again.



**Tell them how much you want to work for them**



Start contacting them to tell them how much you want to work for them.



It doesn’t matter who you speak to first. Start with anyone. Just start.



Tell them, (in your own way), “You are my favorite company. It’s my dream to work for you. If you have any aspect that could use a little help, **let me do it, and I promise you it’ll thrive. I’m that passionate about this.”**
