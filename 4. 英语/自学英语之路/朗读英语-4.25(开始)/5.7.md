**Antifragile**

PROLOGUE 



I. HOW TO LOVE THE WIND 



Wind // extinguishes a candle and energizes fire. 

```
extinguish /ɪkˈstɪŋgwɪʃ/
energize /ˈenədʒaɪz/
```



Likewise with randomness, uncertainty, chaos: you want to use them, not hide from them. 

```
uncertainty /ʌnˈsɜ:tnti/

```



You want to be the fire and wish for the wind. 

This summarizes this author’s nonmeek attitude to randomness and uncertainty. 

```
summarize /ˈsʌməraɪz/
author /ˈɔ:θə(r)/
attitude /ˈætɪtju:d/

```



We just don’t want to just survive uncertainty, to just about make it. 

We want to survive uncertainty and, in addition—like a certain class of aggressive Roman Stoics—have the last word. 

The mission is how to domesticate, even dominate, even conquer, the unseen, the opaque, and the inexplicable. How? 



II. THE ANTIFRAGILE 



Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
