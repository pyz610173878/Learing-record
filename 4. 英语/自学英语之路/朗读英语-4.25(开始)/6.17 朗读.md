## **Your Relationship with Failure (Part 5)**



Failures happen. This is part of life. While other people may make a huge deal (out of it), is it really that big of a deal? So what if you have a spectacularly bad failure! That isn’t the end. It’s just a learning experience, so (learn from it). Life continues the next day.

```
 /spek'tækjuləli/   引人注目的;惊人的
 /ˈfeɪljə(r)/       失败;不成功
  /ɪkˈspɪəriəns/    经验；实践
```



People may （criticize you）. You （may be） embarrassed.上扬 Accept the consequences, and then get （right back to it） and re-engage.



You needn’t retreat and slink away in shame. Be proud that you failed. So many people are too cowardly to even try working on something meaningful. They talk themselves out of pursuing bold ideas before they begin. They treat the prospect of failure as a reason to quit before they start.



Many of Disney’s ideas, including some rides they tried, had to be scrapped and replaced. Each ride was a big project unto itself, so some of those failures ended in the death of a project. But the death of a project doesn’t have to kill the big picture vision.
