l**1. Choose High Impact Tasks**



By Leo Babauta



This starts at the beginning of the week, and the /beginning of each day. 

Intentionally choose the high impact tasks before you start the week or day.

```
在开始一周或一天的工作之前，有意识地选择影响大的任务
```



So each week(上扬), I think about what I want to accomplish. 

```
我会思考我想要完成的目标。
我想的是，我要完成的任务
```



/What high impact tasks will I focus on? 

```
什么重要的任务是我将要专注再上面的
foucus on 专注再什么上面  影响大的任务上面
我将专注于哪些重要的任务呢？

```



Then I do the same at the beginning of each day: 

```
然后我在每天开始的时候做同样的事情
事情是哪里来的？哪里有事情这个单词？压根没有啊
```



what high impact tasks /do I want to accomplish today?

```
我今天要完成哪些重要的任务？
```



(To decide) if something is a high impact task, I ask myself:

连读

```
决定某事是否为高影响任务
我会先问自己
```



* Does (this align) with what I want to create long-term?

```
long-tern 长远的
这跟我想要长期创造的东西是否一致
align 一致 一条线
```

You use **with** when making a comparison or contrast between the situations of different people or things. 同，与，跟(…相比或对照)

* We're not like them. It's different **with** us...我们和他们不一样,我们不那么做。
* Sometimes I'm busy and sometimes I'm not. It's the same **with** most jobs.我时忙时闲，大多数工作都是如此。











* Will this make a big impact on my life and the lives of others?
* Will I care about this /at the end of this year? Will it move /the needle in an important way?



The answer is likely to be either Yes or No/ for all three questions. It would be rare to be a Yes for one question /and No for (the others). But these questions help train the mind/ on the high impact tasks, so after awhile, you don’t even have to ask them — you can just tell.



Put 1-3 of these at the top of your list each day (depending on how much time you have).
