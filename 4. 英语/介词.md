I live in a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one sister, and I was born last. My father
teaches mathematics, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital. My brothers are very smart and
work hard in school. My sister is a nervous girl, but she is very kind. My grandmother also lives with us.
She came from Italy when I was two years old. She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food!
