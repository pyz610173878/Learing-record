````

````



This is where things get real. (Up until) this moment, things (were just) abstractions.

```

When we meet resistance, our patterns show up. These patterns and the fears that lead to them are exactly why we haven’t created the life we want yet. They’re why we let ourselves fall into routine and obligation. It’s not our way to face the fears.
The work begins here: turn towards the fears and be with them. Love them. Live the life you want to create in the moment when the fears show up: for me, that means being with the fears with a sense of curiosity, wonder, adventure. Intimacy, nourishment, service. Vibrancy and strength. Diving into the fears like I’d dive into the ocean — with relish and love.
How do you want to live when the fears show up?
Creating the life you want means living it, as you create it.
What will you create from this moment forward?
