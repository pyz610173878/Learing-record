**Create a New Version of Yourself**





If you believe you are someone who exercises every day, then being sedentary for days in a row is// not really an option. You (get up and 轻声) move.

**exercise** /ˈeksəsaɪz 锻炼

**sedentary** /ˈsedntri/ 少活动的

```
如果你认为自己是一个每天都在锻炼的人，那么连续几天久坐不动，其实是不可能的。你要站起来，活动
```



If you believe that you eat compassionately, then meat isn’t an option. You eat plants.

```
如果你吃东西富有同情心，那么吃肉就不是一个好的选择，你吃植物。
```





If you believe that you are kind, then yelling at your kids isn’t an option. You give them love.
What’s the new version of yourself you’d like to become?
Visualize that new version of you. Feel what it would feel like. It’s an act of creativity, an act of imagination.
Create that new version of yourself. How do they feel, how do they act, what do they do when they are stressed, how do they react to difficult situations?
Now become that person. Become the new being you conjured up.
